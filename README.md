# Game of Life
This is the classic game of life. The board is 5x5. Here are the rules: 

1. A cell has up to eight neighbors (top, topright, right, bottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft)
2. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (under-population)
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation (survival)
4. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overcrowding)
5. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)

Try out some of these [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns)! Some of them are too big for this board so try out the smaller ones.

## How to play
Simply open up the index.html file on your browser. The game loads with a default configuration. At any time, you can change the board by clicking on cells to toggle them. Simply click the "Next Generation" button to progress.
